      <p> The Cease Traffic Fundraiser is dedicated to support Human Trafficking victims, in this case we are beneffiting the Valley Crisis Center with a $2,080 donation that will go towards an emergency safe house program that is staffed 24-hours a day, 7 days a week.</p> 
     
      <p>This program assists in helping people affected by Human Trafficking with re-establishing secure housing, jobs and school. During the stay in this emergency safe house, the program also offers group activities such as art projects, reading time with kids, financial planning and any other service that a person may need assistance in. Advocates provide crisis intervention, safety planning, case management, peer counseling and even support groups. The safe house provides services to men, women and children from all different lifestyles and backgrounds, while they also provide services in different languages.</p>
