Cease Traffic Mock Fundraiser (For Business Society at UC Merced)   10/2020 – 11/2020
Co-Team Leader (2-member team)

▪ During the intern process to join Business Society, the position of Research and Development was filled by me having experience in basic web development in HTML.

▪ The website was composed from HTML for the structure of the webpage and CSS/Bootstrap for the front-end part of the website.

▪ This website had all the information about our mock fundraiser for ceasing human trafficking, who we represent (Business Society), links to our social media platforms, membership forms, contact information, and purchase forms for our raffle and T-Shirts.
